# GEngine | Re
A 2D Game Engine built on SDL2.
A Rewrite of an old project of mine.

*This is a __work-in-progress__ project, expect no support.*

## Important Notes:
Frametiming is still inaccurate, might switch to nano-second based timing.

## To-Do:
- [x] Base Engine Loop
- [x] Frame/Logic Timing
- [x] Input Handler
- [ ] Object/Scene based rendering
- [ ] Object/Instances
- [x] Audio Module
- [x] Resources/Texture loading
- [x] Resources/Audio loading
- [x] Resource Manager
